Used to be a research scientist/structural biologist. The exciting moment was when I uncovered the internal atomic 3D images of those interest macro-molecules, those little harding-working guys in our body.

Due to those heavy computational works for research, I fell in love with code. I taught myself everything related to computer and programming. Starting with Java, then python, then JavaScript, then clouds and more. I enjoy writing clean and excellent code to solve real world problem.
